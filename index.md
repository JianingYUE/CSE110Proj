## About Me as a Programmer

>Self-introduction 
I'm Jianing Yue, I started learning code four years ago. My first programming language was **Python**, then I learned **JAVA**, and also came into contact with **C** and **C++**. But I don't think I became a software engineer, I didn't complete other programs besides homework. Still trying to become a good programmer then become a SE.
